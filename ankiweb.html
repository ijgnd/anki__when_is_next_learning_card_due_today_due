shows the time when the next learning card due today is due at the bottom of the main screen.

Before you install this add-on have a look at the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1836212767" rel="nofollow">Deck Counts Now/Later</a> which shows in the deck list the time until the next review becomes due.

if you find an issue/bug please tell me <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__when_is_next_learning_card_due_today_due" rel="nofollow">on github</a>. Posting on github is better than just leaving a review becomes github notifies me about new issues and you can actually have a conversation there.
